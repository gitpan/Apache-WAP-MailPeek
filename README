This is a simple module to demonstrate the use of delivery of WML with mod_perl.
It was written to accompany an article in the Perl Journal #20.

After enabling WML for Apache with:

    addtype text/vnd.wap.wml                wml
    addtype text/vnd.wap.wmlscript          wmls
    addtype application/vnd.wap.wmlc        wmlc
    addtype application/vnd.wap.wmlscriptc  wmlsc
    addtype image/vnd.wap.wbmp              wbmp

You need to have mod_perl and Mail::Cclient 1.1 installed.

You can install this module with 'perl Makefile.PL', 'make', 'make install', 
and set up a Location handler for the module within httpd.conf:

    PerlModule Apache::WAP::MailPeek
    <Location /wmlmail>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::WAP::MailPeek
    </Location>

The included file 'login.wml' can be copied to your htdocs/ directory and used 
to login to the mail.
